This is my new Project. It is completely Electronics device using IOT. The main aim or intension of this project is same as voting machine, but the procedure is not same This is device provide some authentications like Fingerprint and FaceID. The whole feedback from the user is recorded in a the cloud and it is automatically shown the count on this customized IOT cloud platform. And  Blynk cloud IOT platform is i am uses, because of it is completely free. And arduino uno and related essentials are the  required electronic components. The arduino is customizable by  using C language. The project i am divided as four sections.1)QR section, 2)Fingerprint identification 3)face Recognition, 4)Relay control unit and voting section. Each section wanted codes are attached below. If you have any doubt about this  project, you can connect me through both GIthub and Twitter(@blessen2baby).
